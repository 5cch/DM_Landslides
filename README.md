# Libraries
To run the code those libraries are required :  
arules  
pheatmap  
ggplot2  
sf  
dplyr  
rpart

caret  

# Datasets
To run the code the paths of the datasets must be replaced with the absolute paths on the used machine. The datasets' relative paths in the repository are :  

For America :  
path_data = "./datasets/america/landslides.csv"  

For Savoy :  
path_merged = "./datasets/savoie/landslide_meteo.csv"
